# Event Planning

#### Date: Mar 18 2017, v.1.0

#### By _Ryan Jones_

## Description

Event Planning, is a command line application that I built with Java. I used JUnit tests and gradle tests to build and ladder one method at a time, making sure that everything was working at each interval. The application allows the user to plan a party or event, with the use of branching there is a fair amount of interaction from adding, removing, printing, price checking, etc.
